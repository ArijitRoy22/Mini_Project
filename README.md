### This app was developed for reading data from an NPK sensor through firebase
### It was a part of our mini project where we created an IoT senosr to measure the level of Nitrogen, Potassium and Phosphours then it sent the data to the firebase through which our app is conneceted. To access our app user should be login to the app which is handled by the firebase and then the realtime data is shown in the app, It also gives alert if the level of NPK goes below a certain point.
